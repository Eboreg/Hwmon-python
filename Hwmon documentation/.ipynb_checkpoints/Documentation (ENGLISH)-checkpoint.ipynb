    "\n",
    "## Motivations to create Hwmon \n",
    "\n",
    "Hwmon has been created with the intention of replacing Linux libraries and APIs with which to obtain system information without the need to depend on dependencies outside a standard Linux system, i. e. that nothing needs to be installed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only requirements for running Hwmon on a system are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The OS is Linux \n",
    "- Have python 3 \n",
    "\n",
    "Hwmon is also a library developed expressly by and for Python 3 with functions that are easy to understand and operate, which read and synthesize in the same library all the useful information for monitoring a Linux system that can be found in the /ys, /proc and /dev folders. So only the information that the system itself has recorded will be obtained. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use Hwmon instead of other bookstores? \n",
    "\n",
    "As already mentioned, Hwmon does not require any dependencies or programs and is a library created with the standard Python 3 libraries. Which is not the case with other bookstores as they are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Pysensors\n",
    "- lm-sensors\n",
    "- psutil\n",
    "\n",
    "Where you need files and programs to be able to work, so if you're missing some of that, it just doesn't work. They are also heavier solutions in terms of file sizes than Hwmon. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Is it really a viable alternative to lm-sensors? \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. Hwmon is able to return and print the same information that is obtained when installing and running sensors. \n",
    "\n",
    "![https://github.com/Guillermo-C-A/Hwmon-python/blob/master/rd_data/hwmon%20vs%20lm-sensors.png](attachment:imagen.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "And it even prints the information on the screen in a nice and friendly way so that it is more useful and easy to understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What information can I get from Hwmon and where does he get it from? \n",
    "\n",
    "Hwmon is able to extract: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Information from the sensors available on the computer \n",
    "- Processor information \n",
    "- System memory information \n",
    "- Sent and received packet information \n",
    "- USB devices connected to the computer \n",
    "- Disks connected to the computer \n",
    "\n",
    "All this information is extracted respectively from the following sites: \n",
    "\n",
    "- /sys/class/hwmon\n",
    "- /proc/cpuinfo y /proc/stat\n",
    "- /proc/meminfo\n",
    "- /proc/net/dev\n",
    "- /dev/input/by-id\n",
    "- /dev/disk/by-id\n",
